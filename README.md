# 06-Server-Side-API-Weather-Dashboard-Challenge


## Description

For this project we were tasked to create a weather dashboard site that pulled information from an api amd displayed the weather for that area the user inputs.

What I did was created a container with a search field that would also hold all of the data from the weather api. Then I went and styled it to make it more interesting to the user. I also used the Unsplash Api for my background of the site with the keywork "clouds" That way whenever the user refreshs the page a new random image is displayed to give them a different experience every time.

Then I set up the function so when the api is called it goes through the DOM and selects the specific elements in the HTML.

For this application I was able to display the current weather but not the forecast. What I will do is go back and adjust it so that the forecast is displayed and functions properly.
